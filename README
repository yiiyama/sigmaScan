SigmaScan - tool for rapid prototyping of analyses

1. What it does
This tool calculates signal significance over a given set of background samples.
The same set of signal and backgrounds can be scanned over for different analysis cuts, thus enabling a quick first check of the feasibility of the analyses.

2. How it works
The workflow is split into two steps.
In the first, signal and backgrounds are separately filtered according to generator-level information, and made into small ntuples that only contain analysis-level variables.
The result of this step is common to all analyses which targets the same type of signal.
In the second step, a scan over all signal samples is done using the user-specified list of cuts.

3. Usage
Do
make
in this directory. Then see the example and the line-by-line explanation in exec.cc.

4. Usage of the output
The output of the scan is a tree containing the calculated significances and the optimized parameter values.
Each entry of the tree corresponds to one signal point.
A TCanvas with a stack plot of the backgrounds overlaid with the signal for each variable is produced and stored in the for each point.
See printPlots.cc in this directory for an example of the output usage.
